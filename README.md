- 👋 Hi, I’m @VyomVyas25
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics Engineering 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ROS 2 packages, Nav2 algorithms in ROS 2 Humble, and autonomous manipulator algorithms in MoveIt 2, with a solid background in ROS Noetic packages and dependencies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on robotics projects involving robotics system, autonomous navigation and path planning algorithms, and manipulator control algorithms. Additionally, I’m open to contributing to sensor-based autonomous systems, object      detection, and projects leveraging GPS, LiDAR, and vision-based technologies. My experience includes participating in the NXP Cup for autonomous traversal and developing an all-terrain Mars rover with autonomous navigation and a 6-DoF robotic 
     arm.
